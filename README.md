Clone the project or download as zip. You can execute the project with the command “python3 main.py” in console

To use the project, select which option you would like (1-4) in the main() function (top of file main.py) and enter any sequences or instances if the option requires it such as in option 3 for testing a specific sequence for validating results.

Option 1 – run the genetic algorithm for a single given instance

Option 2 – run the genetic algorithm for all instances

Option 3 – run the deterministic placement and evaluation for a given sequence and instance

Option 4 – run the genetic algorithm for a single given instance, and flip through the k best results

You can select an option by uncommenting the line

You can also run the comparison script with “python3 compare.py” which compares the genetic algorithm against a random and greedy algorithm – which draws individual plots and gives a report in console

For operations that run successive visualisations, such as option 2 and compare.py, plot windows must be closed before computation will continue
